* Provide a flash ram setting to perform init on boot
* Understand boot initialization
* The serial protocol suffers if you ^C when < chars are sent;
  so we need a 'resync' process.  A string of 8 0xff followed by an 0x0
  seems like a reasonable choice.
* Revamp the web site to simplify the choices, and enable ledscroll
  to display a message.

--- Game todo ---
Really should use a mutex or something to avoid thread clash
Set the umask before we open the fifo


--- Long Term ---
We should be able to control up to 12 strings by adding the
  upper six pins of port D.
If I can figure out how to keep Tone.cpp out of the .pde build,
  we could switch to Timer2


--- So Long term it might as well be never ---
Right now, we lock step the strings; if you're going to write to
  more than 1 string, you have to do them at the same time.  That is
  not theoretically required; the pins could be inter mingled in the
  ring buffer.  You could theoretically avoid that by having a slightly
  more sophisticated available()/writep algorithm.
