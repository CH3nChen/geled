--- Long Term ---
We should be able to control up to 12 strings by adding the
  upper six pins of port D.
If I can figure out how to keep Tone.cpp out of the .pde build,
  we could switch to Timer2


--- Never ---
Right now, we lock step the strings; if you're going to write to
  more than 1 string, you have to do them at the same time.  That is
  not theoretically required; the pins could be inter mingled in the
  ring buffer.  You could theoretically avoid that by having a slightly
  more sophisticated available()/writep algorithm.
